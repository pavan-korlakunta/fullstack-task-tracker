# Fullstack Task Tracker - Project Progress

## Project Overview
**Name:** Fullstack Task Tracker
**Goal:** Build a complete task management app with authentication, deployment, Docker, and CI/CD
**Student Level:** Beginner (knows HTML, CSS, JavaScript basics, Git basics)

## Tech Stack

- [ ] Create Express backend with API
- [ ] Connect to MongoDB
- [ ] Add user authentication
- [ ] Basic deployment

### Phase 2: Docker (Days 4-5)
- [ ] Dockerize frontend
- [ ] Dockerize backend
- [ ] Docker Compose setup
- [ ] Deploy with containers

### Phase 3: CI/CD (Day 6)
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] Automated testing
- [ ] Automated deployment

## Current Progress

### Completed Steps:
✅ Step 1: Verified Node.js installation (v24.13.0)
✅ Step 2: Created project folders (client/ and server/)
✅ Step 3: Created React frontend with Vite (running on http://localhost:5173/)
✅ Step 4: Initialized backend with npm (package.json created)
✅ Step 5: Installed Express framework
✅ Step 6: Created and started Express server (running on http://localhost:5000/)
✅ Step 7: Connected frontend to backend with CORS - WORKING!
✅ Step 8: Set up MongoDB Atlas cluster (will connect on deployment)
✅ Step 9: Created task API endpoints (in-memory storage for now)
✅ Step 10: Built task manager UI - FULLY FUNCTIONAL!
✅ Step 11: Deployed backend to Render (https://fullstack-task-tracker-ftuc.onrender.com)
✅ Step 12: Deployed frontend to Vercel (https://fullstack-task-tracker-tawny.vercel.app)
✅ Step 13: Created Dockerfile for backend and built Docker image
✅ Step 14: Ran backend in Docker container on port 5000
✅ Step 15: Created GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow for backend
✅ Step 16: Created Dockerfile for frontend and built Docker image
✅ Step 17: Ran frontend in Docker container on port 3000
✅ Step 18: Created GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow for frontend
✅ Step 19: Both CI/CD pipelines running successfully on GitHub

### What You've Built:
✅ Full-stack task tracker application
✅ React frontend with Vite
✅ Node.js/Express backend with REST API
✅ CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
✅ Deployed to production (Vercel + Render)
✅ Dockerized backend AND frontend
✅ CI/CD pipelines for both backend and frontend
✅ Git version control with automated testing

### Technologies Mastered:
1. **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Fetch API
2. **Backend:** Node.js, Express, CORS, Environment Variables
3. **Database:** MongoDB Atlas (setup complete)
4. **Deployment:** Vercel, Render
5. **DevOps:** Docker, Dockerfile, Container management (both frontend & backend)
6. **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, Automated testing and building
7. **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

### Docker Skills Learned:
- Created Dockerfiles for both frontend and backend
- Built Docker images for both applications
- Ran containers with port mapping
- Container logs and management
- Understanding of containerization benefits
- Multi-container application setup

### CI/CD Skills Learned:
- Created GitHub Actions workflows
- Automated testing on code push
- Automated Docker image building
- Understanding of continuous integration
- Separate pipelines for frontend and backend
- Enterprise-level DevOps practices

### Key Concepts You Now Understand:
- Full-stack architecture (frontend/backend separation)
- REST API design
- Client-server communication
- Environment configuration
- Cloud deployment
- Containerization
- Enterprise development workflow

### Next Steps (Optional):
1. Add user authentication (JWT)
2. Connect MongoDB properly
3. Create Docker Compose for multi-container setup
4. Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions
5. Add more features (edit tasks, filters, search)
6. Learn Kubernetes for container orchestration

**Congratulations!** You've gone from beginner to building and deploying a production-ready full-stack application with Docker in one session!

### Next Steps:
1. Verify Node.js installation
2. Create project structure
3. Initialize frontend with Vite + React
